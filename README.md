# Rice
A collection of ricing guide, by the people who made them

Pull it, fork it, PR it, DWTFYUT it. This is meant to be a centralized place for storing ricing guides, by the people who make them.

To add a new guide, give it a filename 

```
<component_to_be_riced>_<rice_name>.md
```

Obviously, the guide should be in markdown format. `rice_name` need not to be the theme name that is modified. Conside the rice itself as a whole setup, and give it a name. For example, there could be a guide named `i3_blueberry` which will be about ricing the i3 WM. `blueberry` will merely be the rice name and will act as an unique identifier of the rice in the repository. If there are collisons, append the new rice will something unique, like `i3_blueberry_again`.

Guide Format
============

1. Contributor : [name_of_the_contributor] (website_to_a_profile_of_the_contributor)

2. Riced component : <component_to_be_riced> [Do not write categorical name of the component, like Window Manager. Instead, write the title of the component itself, like i3.]

3. Screenshot : This is the point where a user will decide whether its up to his or her taste or not, so give good screenshots. Give WTSIWYG screenshots. Screenshots will be saved in the `Screenshots` folder at the root directory. Screenshots should have a name 

```
<component_to_be_riced>_<rice_name>_shot_<shot_number>.jpg/.png
```

Shot number is an always incrementing number for a particular rice to differentiate between particular versions, or to store multiple screenshots of it.

4. Requirements : List all the required components here. Any window themes, icon themes, color schemes, software, list everything. List everything with their purpose. PROVIDE LINKS TO EVERYTHING.

5. Guide : Write the actual step by step explanation of the guide. Make each step as atomic as possible. Keep the language simple and easy.

6. Credits : If you've used any third party software and/or themes in the rice, mention them. Preferably with an active link.
